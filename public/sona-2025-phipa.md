1\. Key Points I Found Interesting

\- A nationwide ₱20 per kilo rice program will be launched through Kadiwa centers.

\- The President promised overtime pay for public school teachers by the end of the year.

\- "Halos 12,000 bagong pampublikong paaralan ang papatayo" - a massive step for public education.

\- Government to go after "economic saboteurs" and illegal rice traders.



2\. Key Points I Found Weird

\- Plans to penalize sabungero spectators, even if they are rich, were emphasized strongly.

\- Some promises sound recycled from previous years but were framed like new plans.



3\. Reflection



SONA 2025 was full of big goals, especially in education, food security, and infrastructure. The idea of ₱20 rice and more schools is exciting and shows that the administration knows what matters to the people. 



However, the promises are many, but so far, they haven't been fulfilled. Many of the issues mentioned were already raised in past SONAs, yet they remain unresolved. Hope is not enough; follow-through is what people are waiting for. The speech sounds good, but real change happens when there is real action, not just applause.
