**2\.  Give 1-3 key points from SONA 2025 that you found weird for any reason**

\- Plans to penalize sabungero spectators, even if they are rich, were emphasized strongly.

\- Some promises sound recycled from previous years but were framed like new plans.



**3\.  Write 2 paragraphs of reflection**



SONA 2025 was full of big goals, especially in education, food security, and infrastructure. The idea of ₱20 rice and more schools is exciting and shows that the administration knows what matters to the people. The promises felt like a way to win the people over, showcasing that the government undestands what we need. But at the same time, they sounded too good to be true.

The promises are many, but so far, they haven't been fulfilled. Many of the issues mentioned were already raised in past SONAs, yet they remain unresolved. Hope is not enough; follow-through is what people are waiting for. The speech sounds good, but real change happens when there is real action, not just applause.



**4\. What 1 word/ phrase/ or sentence do you have for the Philippines after hearing SONA 2025?**
